# Autism-Detection
Early Detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder Using Convolutional Neural Networks
This project focuses on the development of a web application for detecting Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and providing users with relevant resources. The application offers two core functionalities: uploading and analyzing facial images to predict autism traits, and finding nearby autism support centers. Users can sign in or sign up to use the service, with data privacy ensured through secure login methods. The autism prediction model uses advanced machine learning techniques to provide users with a probable diagnosis based on image inputs. Additionally, users can search for nearby autism centers by entering their location, and a split-screen view displays both an interactive map and a list of autism centers in the area. The system is designed to support early detection and intervention, and to streamline access to autism-related services for both parents and caregivers. Integrating Google Maps API ensures accurate geographic data while offering a user-friendly experience. This solution aims to provide a convenient and supportive tool for autism awareness and assistance.
